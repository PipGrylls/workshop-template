<h3>Text Editor</h3>

A text editor is the piece of software you use to view and write code. If you
have a preferred text editor, please use it. Suggestions for text editors are,
Notepad++ (Windows), TextEdit (macOS), Gedit (GNU/Linux), GNU Nano, Vim.
Alternatively, there are IDE's (integrated development environments) that have
more features specifically for coding, such as VS Code. There are also IDEs
specific to languages which will be listed in the appropriate section(s) below.
